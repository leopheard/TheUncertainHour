Obscure policies, forgotten histories and why America’s like this. <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=476015630">The Uncertain Hour</a> explains our weird, complicated, and often unequal economy – and why some people get ahead and some get left behind. Host Krissy Clark dives into obscure policies and forgotten histories to explain why America is like it is – from welfare reform, to the drug war, to why it’s so much harder to get a “good job” right now. The Uncertain Hour goes deep to tell us how we got here and what it all means.<br>
